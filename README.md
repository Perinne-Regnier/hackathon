### About this project

In a team of 3 people, I had 24h to developp a project about environment.
We chose to analyse a dataset about the world's CO2 emissions.
We set up the United Nations goal for 2030 in a plot then try to find solutions to reach it.

The current project's version is not the one we made during the hackathon but a completed one.
